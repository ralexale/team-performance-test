## Project Description

The Coupon Management and Redemption System is a crucial component of Riwi's e-commerce project. This system allows users to manage and redeem discount coupons for online purchases. The API offers the following key functionalities:

### User Management
### Coupon Management
### Coupon Redemption
### Product Management

## General Business Rules

1. A registered user can redeem a specific coupon only once. The system validates that the coupon is not in the user's redemption history before allowing redemption.

2. A coupon must have at minimum:
   - A unique code
   - An expiration date
   - A discount percentage

3. When redeeming a coupon, the system requires:
   - User identifier
   - Product identifier
   If redemption rules are met, the system returns:
   - Redeemed coupon information
   - New product price after discount
   The redemption is then recorded in the user's coupon redemption history.

4. The application is pre-loaded with a minimum of 10 products in the database upon initialization.

## Database Schema

The system uses a MySQL database with the following structure:
